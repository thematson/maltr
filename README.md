# Maltr.io

 This app complements micro breweries' current marketing strategies by giving their clients a tool to search for additional local sellers of their favorite brews.

 Once subscribed, the brewers will have the opportunity to update their sellers' locations. These locations will populate on a map powered by Google Maps, along with a review of the establishment furnished by Google Reviews, enabling their clients to always know where they can find their favorite craft micro brew.

 You can visit the current build at [this link](https://thematson.github.io/maltr/).
